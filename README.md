# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description
This application is a social network API that uses a NoSQL database, in this case Mongo DB. It is a RESTful API that allows users to create, update, and delete users and thoughts in a database. Users can also add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list and create and delete reactions to thoughts.

Note, this application does not have a front end. It is tested using Insomnia or Postman etc.

Also, instead of a Delete route for the Reactions, we are using a Put route to update the reaction array. This is because we are not deleting the reaction, but rather removing it from the array.
